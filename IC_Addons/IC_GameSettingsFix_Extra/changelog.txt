26      June 2025 - v0.1.8
 - Changed how the addon finds the settings file with Irisiri's edit.
29   January 2025 - v0.1.7
 - Changing default LevelupAmountIndex to x100 because more people use Level Up addon than don't. And everyone *should* be using the Level Up addon.

25   October 2024 - v0.1.5

10      July 2024 - v0.0.4

10      July 2024 - v0.0.2
