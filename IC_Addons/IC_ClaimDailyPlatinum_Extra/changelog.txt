18  December 2024 - v0.2.2
 - Slight bug fix to Celebration rewards code that will allow it to claim multiple codes for the same day - if such a thing ever occurs (it probably won't).
04  December 2024 - v0.2.1
 - Celebration rewards now have a proper timer (when a proper timer exists - falls back to 8 hours if not).
04  December 2024 - v0.2.0
 - Adding support to claim celebration rewards.
25  November 2024 - v0.1.3
 - Fixed a minor display issue with the Platinum Daily Boost timer.
 - Fixed Daily Boost Timer so it actually ticks down between checks.
19  November 2024 - v0.1.2
 - Fixed a bug where bonus chests weren't being added to the list of bonuses to claim because of a stupid copy-paste issue.
 - Fixed a bug where claiming message would be visually cut-off.
18  November 2024 - v0.1.1
 - Hopefully fixing a bug where some bonus chests weren't appearing in the shop data.
 - Fixing an issue where disabled timers would continue to run.
18  November 2024 - v0.1.0
 - Adding support to claim the free bonus chests that packs on sale get if you've already bought them. They are referred to by the addon as `Free Premium Pack Bonus Chests`.
 - Added a timer for Platinum Daily Boost expiry if it's active.
 - Staggered the starting check times for each claim so that it doesn't spam the server after 1 minute.
 5  November 2024 - v0.0.9
 - Fixing a bug where Free Offer IDs wouldn't reset after being claimed.
 3  November 2024 - v0.0.8
 - Annoyingly I've had to add extra checks to the Platinum claim due to CNE being CNE with the next reset time.
 2  November 2024 - v0.0.7
 - Changed the way the timers work to avoid drift.
23   October 2024 - v0.0.6
 - Adding support for automatically revealing the weekly offers to minimise their time drift (since their 7 day clock doesn't start until after they've been revealed).
23   October 2024 - v0.0.5
 - Attempting yet another further fix that will prevent large values for days claimed and yet never actually claiming.
20   October 2024 - v0.0.4
 - Fixed a few bugs caused by typos.
 - Added a slight delay to checking for the updated cooldown after a successful claim.
 - Removed redundant code.
19   October 2024 - v0.0.3
 - Fixed (hopefully) a bug where ClaimDailyPlatinum and PotionSustain would be incompatible.
19   October 2024 - v0.0.2
 - Adding a little bit of sanity checking when sending server calls.
 - Renaming a variable because I realised it might be overwriting a global of the same name.
18   October 2024 - v0.0.1
 - An add on that will claim your daily platinum automagically so you don't have to.
